## 📖 About
 This project was an assignment recieved in our Computing Fundamentals module at university where we were tasked with creating a website for a Bank using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. The website had to include certain pages and features such as a mortgage calculator and form validation. The Second part of the assignment was to create two simple shell scripting programs, one being a file organiser and the other being a disk usage checker representing disk usage. I recieved a first for this assignment, recieving a grade of 75/100
